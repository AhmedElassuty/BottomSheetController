# IOS-BottomSheet

A demo project to show how to build bottom sheets in iOS, like iOS 10 Maps app. Check my answer on [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37967555/how-to-mimic-ios-10-maps-bottom-sheet/38152508#38152508).

I'm working on a library on the [develop branch](https://github.com/AhmedElassuty/BottomSheetController/tree/develop) that would have more features.
